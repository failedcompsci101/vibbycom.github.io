            What is Vibby?
          </accordion-heading>
          We live in a TL;DW (Too Long; Didn’t Watch) world and as more video is created, it becomes harder to find the moments that matter. Vibby is an interactive video platform that lets you highlight, share and discuss the best parts of any YouTube video. Our vision is to enable users to understand and utilize video in a more flexible, effective, and efficient way.
